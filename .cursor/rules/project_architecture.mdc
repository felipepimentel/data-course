# People Analytics Project Architecture

The People Analytics system follows a modular architecture centered around the sync command which handles all data processing and report generation.

## Entry Point

The system has a single entry point through [peopleanalytics/cli.py](mdc:peopleanalytics/cli.py):

```bash
python -m peopleanalytics sync --data-dir=data --output-dir=output
