# Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Consolidated Skill-Related Modules**:
   - Created a new unified `skill_base.py` module that combines functionality from both `skill.py` and `skills.py`
   - Removed the duplicate classes and merged their functionality
   - Enhanced the `SkillType` enum with more categories and better mapping
   - Improved the `Skill` class with additional properties and methods
   - Ensured all relationships between skills are properly handled

2. **Organized Domain Classes**:
   - Updated `domain/__init__.py` to export the consolidated domain classes
   - Ensured proper imports throughout the codebase
   - Removed deprecated compatibility aliases

3. **Removed Deprecated Code**:
   - Deleted `skill.py` and `skills.py` which were replaced by the consolidated `skill_base.py`
   - Removed the deprecated `score_calculator.py` utility, replaced with `EvaluationScore` from domain
   - Updated the `sync_commands.py` to use the new `EvaluationScore` class

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `README.md` with information about the new module structure
   - Added usage examples for the new domain classes
   - Documented the project structure and organization

## Benefits

- **Reduced Code Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate functionality across multiple files
- **Better Organization**: Domain concepts are now properly encapsulated
- **Improved API**: Cleaner, more consistent interfaces for domain objects
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Code is now easier to understand and modify
- **Reduced Interdependencies**: Fewer cross-module dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Update Tests**: Make sure all tests work with the new structure
2. **Documentation**: Create more detailed documentation for the domain classes
3. **Review Usages**: Verify that all parts of the codebase using the old modules have been updated
