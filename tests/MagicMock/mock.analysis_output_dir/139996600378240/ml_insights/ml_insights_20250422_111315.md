| Technical Specialist | Programming, Cloud Services, Algorithms | Developer, Engineer, Architect | Toward Technical Leadership |
| People Leader | Team Management, Conflict Resolution, Decision Making | Manager, Director, VP | Toward Executive Leadership |
| Creative Innovator | Design Thinking, Problem Solving, Innovation | Designer, Product Manager, Strategist | Toward Innovation Leadership |
| Analytical Expert | Data Analysis, Critical Thinking, Research | Analyst, Data Scientist, Researcher | Toward Technical Strategy |

## 🔍 Anomaly Detection

### Unusual Performance Patterns

```mermaid

    x-axis ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep"]
    y-axis "Score" 0 --> 5
    line [3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.3, 3.1, 2.2, 4.8] "Actual"
    line-dash [3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0] "Expected Range"
```

### Detected Anomalies

| Employee | Date Range | Anomaly Type | Z-Score | Potential Factors |
|----------|------------|--------------|---------|--------------------|
| Maria Silva | Aug 2023 | Performance Drop | -2.8 | Project change, team restructuring |
| João Oliveira | Sep 2023 | Performance Spike | +3.1 | New role, leadership opportunity |
| Carlos Santos | Jul-Aug 2023 | Engagement Decline | -2.3 | Personal factors, workload increase |

### Anomaly Response Recommendations

1. **Performance Drop (Maria Silva)**
   - Schedule supportive check-in focused on transition challenges
   - Review project allocation and team dynamics
   - Consider additional onboarding for new project

2. **Performance Spike (João Oliveira)**
   - Document success factors for potential replication
   - Explore sustainability of current performance level
   - Consider expanding responsibilities if trajectory maintains

## 📈 Predictive Modeling

### Career Trajectory Prediction

    class A,B,E,I highlight;
```

### Attrition Risk Prediction

| Risk Level | Employees | Key Indicators | Recommended Actions |
|------------|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| 🔴 High (70%+) | 3 | Engagement drop, Missed 1:1s, Skills mismatch | Immediate manager intervention, Compensation review, Career path discussion |
| 🟠 Medium (40-70%) | 7 | Reduced participation, Stagnant progression, Market demand | Growth opportunity discussion, Recognition plan, Work-life balance check |
| 🟢 Low (<40%) | 25 | Consistent engagement, Regular recognition, Growth alignment | Maintain regular check-ins, Long-term development planning |
